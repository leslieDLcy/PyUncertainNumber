**Uncertain Number** refers to a class of mathematical objects useful for risk analysis that generalize real numbers, intervals, probability distributions, interval bounds on probability distributions (i.e. [probability boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_box)), and finite DempsterShafer structures.

## quick start

`PyUncertainNumber` can be used to easily create a `PBox` or an `Interval` object:

```python
from pyuncertainnumber import UncertainNumber as UN

e = UN(
    name='elas_modulus', 
    symbol='E', 
    units='Pa', 
    essence='pbox', 
    distribution_parameters=['gaussian', ([0,12],[1,4])])
```

<!-- add some pbox plots herein -->

## installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### UQ multiverse

UQ is a big world (like Marvel multiverse) consisting of abundant theories and software implementations on multiple platforms. Some notable examples include [OpenCossan](https://github.com/cossan-working-group/OpenCossan) [UQlab](https://www.uqlab.com/) in Matlab and [ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/AnderGray/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl) in Julia, and many others of course. `PyUncertainNumber` builds upon on a few pioneering projects and will continue to be dedicated to support imprecise analysis in engineering using Python.
